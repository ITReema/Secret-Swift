# Secret Swift
This project will use three important iOS technologies together: Touch ID, Face ID and the keychain. The first two are used to identify users biometrically using the fingerprint sensor on iPhones and iPads, or the face scanner on iPhone X or similar; the latter is a secure, encrypted data storage area on every device that you can read and write to.
